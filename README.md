# Power BI Dashboards

This repository contains a collection of sample **Power BI dashboards**
created for **demonstration and portfolio purposes**.\
The dashboards cover different domains such as fraud detection, customer
segmentation, business performance, and industry-specific analytics.

Some dashboards are based on **publicly available datasets** (e.g.,
Statistics Canada), while others were created as **sample projects**
without confidential data.\
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** A few dashboards are in **Persian (Farsi)**, as they were
originally developed in earlier projects, but they are still useful as
portfolio examples.
